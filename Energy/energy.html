                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <div id='container'>
                <img src='http://giipl.in/images/Dirty_earth.png' width="500" style='float: left;'/>
                <p id="problem">In 2015 it was reported that the Earth's atmosphere had a carbon dioxide ppm of 400. This is quite alarming because the safe ppm amount is below 350. What is even more alarming is that we are adding about 2 ppm of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. Therefore, we are lowering the air quality every year. This affects Chicago because it is causing the temperatures to rise and changing weather/climate patterns. For example, it is one of the reasons Chicago has a lot more rain today than it did 100 years ago. One of the main reasons our air quality is so poor is because of nonrenewable energy. Nonrenewable energy sources, such as petroleum or coal, are sources that deplete, which means they diminish in quantity as we use them. Not only are nonrenewable energy sources running out, but they are also harming the environment. They are releasing air pollutants, contaminating the groundwater, causing acidic rain, and much more.  We need to do something about the energy sources we are using to improve the air quality environment we live in, which in turn will improve the quality of life. In Chicago there is a population of about 3 million. If we just had about half of those people work to improve our air quality and environment we live in, it would make a great impact. Below you can find more information about a very practical solution to improving our air quality, which is renewable energy.</p>

                <h2>The Solutions</h2>
                <div id='container'>

                <p id="solution">There are many things people can do to improve the air quality. It is important to remember that you don’t have to take drastic measures in order to help with this problem. There are small steps an individual can take to help improve the air quality. One great thing an individual can do is find ways to start using more renewable energy. At this point and time it is not realistic to use only renewable energy as your main source of energy. However, it is still important that Chicago residents incorporate renewable energy. Using renewable and nonrenewable energy would still  improve the air quality and environment we live in a whole lot. Examples of renewable energy sources include solar energy and wind energy. Because Chicago is a big and busy city, it is not quite realistic to place huge wind turbines in your backyard or on the streets. However, there are small wind turbines that people are able to place on their roofs. These small wind turbines are able to power small household appliances such as laptops and phones, which are one of the things people use the most in their homes. These types of turbines require about 9 mph of wind speed and Chicago’s average wind speed is about 10.3 mph. Therefore, these wind turbines would be practical for Chicago residents. It would also be very practical to install solar panels onto the roofs of Chicago residents. Chicago is not always sunny, which is why the solar panels would only be one part of the energy sources Chicago Residents have. However, it is sunny about half of the year, so they would still make a great impact. Solar panels can be expensive but the City has made them much more affordable and even obtainable. For example, there is the <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/progs/env/solar_in_chicago.html">Chicago Solar Express</a>, which has cut fees, reduced time-in-line for permits, and even streamline processes that come along with obtaining solar panels. Similar to the wind turbines, the solar panels, if only a small number are installed, would power small household items.</p>

                <h2>The Benefits</h2>      
                <div id='container'>
                <img src='http://cache1.asset-cache.net/xd/473097141.jpg?v=1&c=IWSAsset&k=2&d=62CA815BFB1CE4803614E9A26C618C145145F92974FB5D869BAB47914450EDB7E3D34A1264124634' width=500 style='float: left;'/>
                <p id="benefits">The benefits of renewable energy are endless. For one they can save you a ton of money. Because of how urban Chicago Residents are, renewable energy would definitely save us money. We have many appliances in our homes that require a lot of energy. The wind turbines and solar energy would save Chicago Residents money each month. The monthly savings would be about $10-15, which in time adds up. Not only would you be saving money, but you would also be saving the city! By living in this busy city, you are being exposed to more air pollutants than someone living in a rural area. By using renewable energy you are emitting less air pollutants than someone who is not. In addition, you are requiring less energy from nonrenewable sources, which also reduces the air pollutants emitted into the atmosphere. Chicago would be a much cleaner place if people were to use renewable energy sources. Who wouldn’t want that?</p>
